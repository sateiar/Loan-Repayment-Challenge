# Loan-Repayment-Challenge
1 Introduction
At MoneyLion we are constantly working to assess the risk of our applicants more accurately. Being successful
in this objective enables us to better price customers and mitigate losses on our portfolio of loans. The following
challenge asks you to work with a data set of loan repayment. It is intentionally meant to be open ended. The
point is not to arrive at a predetermined answer or search for the lowest possible standard error. Rather, the hope
is that it will force you to ask relevant questions about the data, do some preliminary exploration, perform the
necessary manipulations or aggregations, generate visualizations, and reach conclusions or insights. The most
important thing to remember is that we are evaluating your thought process and ideas! The more you explain
your thinking, in a clear and succinct manner, the better. If you get stuck, describe what additional information
or data you might look to collect, and trying a different idea is highly encouraged.
2 Data
You are provided with 3 files: loan.csv, payment.csv and clarity_underwriting_variables.csv. The files are
comma separated, with the column names in the first row. The detailed description of each column is available
in the MoneyLion Data Scientist Assessment Data Dictionary document. This can be found in the
dictionaries.zip file.
3 Rules
You may use any language, packages, or external libraries for the challenge, though Python or R are
preferred. An IPython notebook might be the best way to show your code and write your
comments/thoughts to follow along. You may refer online for technical reasons but ​ DO NOT​ directly
use any help from other people, sources, online forums, etc., your submission should be solely your
ideas and work. There is no hard limit on the amount of time that can be spent on this challenge.
Please disclose how much time you spent on the challenge when you’ve completed it.
4 Deliverables
A zip file with contents grouped into the following sub-directories (you may omit empty directories):
- data (only include new data files if you have any, DO NOT send back to us the assessment data!)
- notebooks (we appreciate if you include a html format of your notebook as well as your notebook)
- code (if you have some of your own helper functions you use in your assessment)
5 Guidelines
We want to see a model built for predicting the loan risk or quality (loan repayment) on a given
applicant. But before diving into this task, start with more simple analyses as it may inform your model
building process. Take a look at some distributions of some of the variates. Maybe the loan repayment
value can be modified in order to make it easier to model. Perhaps there are some idiosyncrasies for
geographies, or maybe different bands of clearfraudscore partition loan repayment nicely. Some
visualizations may provide insights. Consider the problem in a business context, what would you want
to predict generally? Loans with what type of performance?6 Tips
The Data Scientist position at Moneylion is extremely competitive and we receive lots of applications.
Do consider how you can make yourself stand out from the rest of the candidates. Here are some of the
skills we are looking:
- What insights can you get from the data, did you try to understand it?
- Data preparation, exploration and visualization.
- Clean coding style
- The ability to tell a story using data
- Clearly communicate your thought process, you do not want your reviewer to scratch their head
figuring out what you are doing.
- Back your assumptions with evidence.
- Modeling
